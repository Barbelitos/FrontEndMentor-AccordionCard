## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge was a great way to practice more CSS position property. I have learned a few new things about it.

Also, I have learned how to cancel the :hover effects for touchscreen devices.

Finally, it was good to also apply some JavaScript in the accordion style menu.

### Continued development

I hope to continue improving especially my CSS skills going forward.
